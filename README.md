# JK4Life v0.2
#### A launcher and [patcher](https://github.com/OCircles/JK4Life/wiki/Assembly-Patches) for Jedi Knight / Mysteries of the Sith

In it's current state this is very barebones, but I wanted to put it out anyway just so people could get access to the assembly patches that you can do with this. There's a lot more to be added, so stay tuned for that! For now I'll keep it somewhat mysterious, but trust me it'll be super cool ;)

#### PS: The patching is never done on your original file, it makes a copy
